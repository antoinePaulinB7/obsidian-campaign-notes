# Villains
Who or what are the three major drivers in this campaign? Often these are villains. You don't want to share this with your players. Instead, [create a villain card](https://www.notion.so/Villains-b3727dd8659c41b8984d2cf495af4c0f) for each villain. Add a major goal for each villain and three sub-goals that take them to that goal. Keep these villains to yourself.

# Character Options and House Rules
What are the specifics of character creation for this world? What are the character building limits in this world? What house rules are in play? Share these with your players.

# Patrons and Factions

# Safety Tools
Discuss what safety tools you and your players are comfortable using during this campaign. I recommend including the following safety tools:

-   Write down a list of any potential sensitive topics covered in your campaign and discuss them with your players during your session zero. See [_Consent in Gaming_](https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/) by Monte Cook Games for examples potential topics.
-   Describe your campaign's "lines and veils". Lines are any topics that **will not** come up in any form. Veils are any topics that will be handled **off screen or abstractly**. Ask the players to add any other lines and veils they may have. Write them all down and share them with all of your players.
-   Tell all of your players to say the phrase **"let's pause for a minute"** to break character and address anything coming up in the game that may be uncomfortable. Think of this as a verbal X-card.
