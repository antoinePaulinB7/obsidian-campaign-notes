# Single-Page Lazy DM Prep Template

*This Notion template is designed to help you build a single-session adventure using the eight steps from [Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master](https://slyflourish.com/returnofthelazydm/). Duplicate and edit your copy of this page for your own single-page eight-step prep sheet.* 

*Inspire your adventure with the tables in the [Lazy DM's Workbook](https://slyflourish.com/lazydmsworkbook/) and the [Lazy DM's Companion](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slyflourish/the-lazy-dms-companion?ref=c3zblb).*

*For a larger campaign, consider the full [Lazy DM's Notion Campaign Template](https://www.notion.so/Lazy-Campaign-Template-dcea442b134146839510dcb0b7356e43).*

# Characters

*Fill in the table below with information about the characters. Think about how you can tailor the adventure around their backgrounds and drives.*

# Strong Start

What's your [strong start](https://slyflourish.com/starting_strong.html)? *What powerful event draws the players into the game? What happens right at the beginning of the session?*

Strong Start

# Scenes

*What scenes might occur in the game? Keep a loose grip on these. The game can go anywhere!*

- Scene 1
- Scene 2
- Scene 3

# Secret and Clues

# Fantastic Locations

*What fantastic locations might the characters explore? Think of these like the backdrop to a scene in a play. You'll generally want one location for every 45 minutes of gameplay you're expecting. Give each location one or more interesting features the characters might interact with. Try some [inspirational monuments](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/monuments.html). Make these new pages if you want to add maps or details.*

- L**ocation 1**: feature, feature, feature
- L**ocation 2**: feature, feature, feature

# NPCs

*What [NPCs](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/npc_generator.html) might the characters interact with? Give them an interesting [name](https://slyflourish.com/random_name_generator.html) and use an archetype from a movie for their mannerisms. Make these new pages if you want to keep track of more information or add pictures.*

- NPC 1
- NPC 2

# Monsters

*What monsters might the characters face? What type and quantity of monsters make sense for the situation? Calculate the "[deadly benchmark](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html)". The encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster Challenge Ratings are greater than one quarter of the sum total of character levels or half if they're above 4th level.*  

- **Deadly Encounter Benchmark:**
- Monster 1
- Monster 2
- Monster 3

# Treasure

*Choose some interesting [treasure](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/5e_treasure.html) and maybe a handful of [relics](https://slyflourish.com/random_generators/relics.html).*

- Gold, gems, etc
- Relics
- Items
- 

## Scratchpad

*Use this for text-based combat trackers, hit point tracking, or anything else you need during your game.*
