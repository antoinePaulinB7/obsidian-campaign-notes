# Description
Innocent-looking golden ring. When cast into fire, writing on it starts to appear.

In the Black Tongue, it reads: "ash nazg thrakatul√ªk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul".

Translated into English: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

This ring is a Ring of Power made by [[Sauron]].
